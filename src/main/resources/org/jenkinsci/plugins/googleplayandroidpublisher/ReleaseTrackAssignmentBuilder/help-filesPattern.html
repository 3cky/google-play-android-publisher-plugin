<div>
  Specifies filenames or patterns matching one or more AAB or APK files from which the
  version codes should be read, in order to determine which app versions should
  be re-assigned to a new release track.
  <p/>
  Note that these files should have already been uploaded â€” this build step will
  not do any uploading; it will only move existing app versions from one release
  track to another. To upload app files, use the "Upload Android AAB/APK to Google Play"
  post-build action.
  <p/>
  You can use wildcards like "<tt>**/build/outputs/*/*-release.apk</tt>".<br/>
  See <a href='https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html'>
  the 'includes' attribute of Ant's FileSet</a> for the exact format.<br/>
  Note that multiple entries must be comma-separated.
  <p/>
  The base directory is <a href='ws/'>the build's workspace</a>.
  You can only reference AAB or APK files that are located in your workspace.
  <p/>
  If no value is provided, the default is
  <tt>**/build/outputs/**/*.aab, **/build/outputs/**/*.apk</tt>.
  <hr/>
  This field supports substituting environment variables in the form
  <tt>${SOME_VARIABLE}</tt> or <tt>$SOME_VARIABLE</tt> at build time.
